Project Name: ?????

Creaters: Andres Ugartechea Palma (au2045) & Chi-Ting Tsai (ct2653)

Story: ?????

Concept: The application is intended to bring to the surface of one's exploration of self, especially the discovery of sexualilty as it is commonly tied with stigma and various forms of shame. Humans are sexual beings. There are certain aspects of sexuality that is present in the media that we are now enabled by the internet to access and explore by ourselves. It is natural for adolescents to become curious and inquire more. However, explicit dicussion of sex or anything related it is considered a tabboo, let alone the complication of homosexuality or anything non-heteronormative. We would like to highlight this necessity of open information and conversation about sex and its subjectivity, complexity, and importance to our identity. The app contains shapes and images that construct the interface of a daily electronic device such as a smartphone or a laptop, evoking a sense of relatability to the audience yet distancing them behind the screen throughout the narrative.
