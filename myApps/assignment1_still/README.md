I have been homesick for the second half of the semester. The thing I miss the most from home were the spontaneous drives with friends at midnight.

To represent the persistence of vision from the whooshing lights, I decided to draw lines using a for loop. The lines are specificaly drawn from a point slightly lower to the center of the window(one-third, ruke of third). 
With the one-point perspective, it creates evokes a feeling of moving forawrd quickly. 

To resemble the nights, the colors are specifically those of streetlights and the roads. The white and red with relatiovely high brightness are the passing lights. 
They are shining brightly in the otherwise dark night. Its dissonant yet familiar nature symbolizes diurnal human beings living in the fast-paced modern civilization.  

There is little diversity as the contrasting light source of the night encapsulates the darkness. I wanted to keep it simplistic and straightforward for the audience. 
For interactivity, the audience can choose to speed up or stay at a slower speed. They are differentiated by the additional layer of light beams. 

I decided at that point as this was the most concise way of representing mignight long drives. I am not satisfied as there are some more simple elements that could be added, for example, the moon and stars. 
Or, there is definitely more to be done with composition of shapes and something on the technical side with more complicated functions.  
However, I am happy with the work as the entire project came out of experimentation. I was palying around with drawing lines in different direction to perspective change and suddenly this image hit me.
It was totally unexpected but it made me feel nostalgic. That was why I chose to settle on it.
