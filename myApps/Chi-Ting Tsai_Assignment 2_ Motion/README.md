The image evokes the sense of a starry night especially when looking through a telescope. The blue circles bink, shines in the over all dark gray sky. 
The harmonios blue colors among the star contrast with the monotonous grey. The piece operates on repetitive reappearane of the circles which are drawn on 
specific positions depend on the note played on the MIDI keyboard. The app takes two signals from the MIDI keyboard: pitch and velocity. 
Pitch determines the color and the position of the circles. The higher the pitch, the more upper right it is situated. 
The velocity determines its size. The harder the jeys are pressed, the bigger the cricles. 

I was inspired concert background that coordinates with the music. It was also a good time to put the keyboard to use. I also went to a stargazing event 
last weekend. Therefore, the two ideas naturally merged together. The creative proess stopped as it was it reached a balance where the imagary of a night sky
is clear while the audience can still see the pattern with which the notes are represented. I am yet satisfied. There is definitely much more shapes to be added
and connected to the MIDI messages that construct multiple elements of the night sky such as the Milky way.
