Assignment 1: Lines 
Name: Chi-Ting Tsai
Date: April 6th

This project was inspired by my recent state of living. Having doubts, questions, and different voices debating in the mind, it casues some "minor" headache.
I have come to realize that this issue even though cannot be exterminated completely, there are things I can do to mitigate this discomfort. 
For example, taking care of my physical body helps with the ability to mangae emotional stress. It somehow "quiets down" the chaos in the head. 

To elaborate on a tehnical side, the shifting lines on the left are created using for loops. There are three layers, each increasing its color value, width, and number. 
They represent the distractions that clog your head and disorient your sense of self. 

The continous line in the lower right corner is drawn with the line add vertex function. Its range is controled by a vec2 slider. Its width a int slider. 
Its color by a vec 4 slider coupled with of Random. 
The parameters are designed so that they are all maximized in the begginning and the users will have to turn them down for a calmer picture. 
At last, you can push the button to steer clear of the mental chaos. However, the shifting lines are still there and it takes attention to keep pressing the button.
It signifies that our problems still exists and it takes effort to take care of our mental space. 

Here are the screenshots of the program.
